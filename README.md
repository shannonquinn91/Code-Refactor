# Code-Refactor

Started by using the code provided for class and uploading it and its assets to github.

Began refacting by using more specific tags in place of existing <div> tags. Replaced with <header> <section> <nav> <aside> <article> <footer> <img>

Fixed the broken link 'search engine optimization' by adding the id to the <img>. Looked up a solution online that mentioned links next to floating images need to anchor to the image. 

Moved "hero" image from CSS to html using <img>.

Pushed to github twice- still figuring out when to push, when not to, and how to accurately note on commits. Hoping this comes with experience!

Next, added several comments to CSS file. 
Cleaned up CSS by consolidating classes. Many of the classes were identical in the CSS file. I changed the names of the classes and used them in each <section> to clean up the CSS file.
