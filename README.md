# Code-Refactor

Started by using the code provided for class and uploading it and its assets to github.
Began refacting by using more specific tags in place of existing <div> tags. 
Fixed the broken link 'search engine optimization' by adding the id to the img. Looked up a solution online that mentioned links next to floating images need to anchor to the image. 
Moved "hero" image from CSS to html using <img>
